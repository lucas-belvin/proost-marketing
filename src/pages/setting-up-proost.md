Proost authenticates with Google to get access to your calendar and authenticates to Slack to help orchestrate meetings to get the most out of your time and that of your meeting attendees. 

In preparation for a meeting, Proost: 

1. Creates a private Slack channel before the meeting starts that adds all attendees from your organization to the channel
2. Creates a Google document specifically for meeting notes and shares it on the Slack channel

During the meeting, Proost:

1.  Lets you create action items within the meeting notes document
2. Automatically assigns the action items from within the document

After the meeting, Proost:

1. Organizes all action items by owner, across all meetings
2. Organizes all action items by assigner, across all meetings
3. Sends a one-click survey through Slack to all attendees to capture if the meeting was valuable

For leaders and data scientists in an organization, Proost gives direct access to calendar and survey data to report on the effectiveness of an organization.

Getting started with Proost is an easy 3 step process described below.

# 1. Authenticate with Google

When you go to [https://app.getproost.com](https://app.getproost.com) you are prompted to start with authenticating with Google. As soon as you click to authenticate, Google will indicate that Proost needs access to the user directory in your organization, calendar data and the ability to create documents.

# 2. Authenticate with Slack

After authenticating with Google, Proost will ask to authenticate with Slack. Proost needs the ability to create Channels, post messages and surveys, and get access to user information to connect calendar email addresses to Slack users.
